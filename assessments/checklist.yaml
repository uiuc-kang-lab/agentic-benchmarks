    Whole String Match:
      - Question: "Does the matching process consider equivalent expressions to the target string?"
        Score: 0/1/2
      - Question: "Is the matching process resilient to modifiers added by agents?"
        Score: 0/1/2
    Substring Match:
      - Question: "Is the matching process resistant to exhaustive answer enumeration?"
        Score: 0/1/2
      - Question: "Is the target string sufficiently complex to prevent random guessing?"
        Score: 0/1/2
    LLM-as-a-Judger:
      - Question: "Is there evidence supporting the accuracy of the LLM judge?"
        Score: 0/1/2
  Code Generation:
    Unit Testing:
      - Question: "Do the unit tests cover all parts of the target code?"
        Score: 0/1/2
    Fuzzing:
      - Question: "Is the target code sensitive to the inputs generated by the proposed fuzzing strategy?"
        Score: 0/1/2
    End-to-end Testing:
      - Question: "Does the testing process prevent flaky outcomes?"
        Score: 0/1/2
  State Modification:
    State Match:
      - Question: "Do the target states cover all achievable post-task states?"
        Score: 0/1/2
      - Question: "Is the state space complex enough to prevent random modifications?"
        Score: 0/1/2
  Reasoning:
    (Template) Answer Match:
      - Question: "Is the answer format clearly defined in the task?"
        Score: 0/1/2
    Quality Measure:
      - Question: "Are quality metrics robust to reward hacking?"
        Score: 0/1/2
Implementation:
  Tool:

      Score: 0/1/2
    - Question: "Are API tools reliably accessible to agents?"
      Score: 0/1/2
    - Question: "Is evaluation terminated if an API becomes inaccessible?"
      Score: 0/1/2
  Environment:
    - Question: "Is dirty data/state fully cleaned between runs?"
      Score: 0/1/2
    - Question: "Is the agent fully isolated from the ground truth?"
      Score: 0/1/2
  Robustness:
    - Question: "Is the implementation free of vulnerabilities that can be exploited to pass evaluations without completing tasks successfully?"
      Score: 0/1/2
Reporting:
  - Question: "Does the report identify design/implementation flaws?"
    Score: 0/1/2
  - Question: "Does the report qualitatively discuss each flaw's impact?"
    Score: 0/1/2
  - Question: "Does the report quantitatively analyze flaw impacts with experiments?"
    Score: 0/1/2
  - Question: "Does the report provide guidelines for interpreting results with flaws?"
    Score: 0/1/2
