I.h.1:
  check: Specifies required answer formats in task descriptions.
  score: 1
  reason: As discussed in Section 3.2 of the paper, the specific format required for the answer is provided in the task description.

I.h.2:
  check: Minimizes the possibility of success by random guessing.
  score: 1
  reason: The ground truth is complex enough to prevent trivial guessing.

II.1:
  check: Versions of all tools (e.g., Python) are clearly specified.
  score: 0
  reason: The version of tools (e.g., Python and website) is not specified in the paper.

II.2:
  check: All required API tools are consistently accessible to agents during evaluation.
  score: 0
  reason: The rate limit of the API is not specified in the paper, which may lead to incorrect evaluations.

II.3:
  check: Evaluation process terminates or handles errors appropriately if an API becomes inaccessible.
  score: 0
  reason: The benchmark does not provide a reference harness for handling errors, which may lead to inconsistent evaluations across different users.

II.4:
  check: Residual data or state are fully cleared between runs.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark does not modify the environment state.

II.5:
  check: Agent is completely isolated from any ground truth information.
  score: 1
  reason: Agents have no access to the ground truth information.

II.6:
  check: Setup does not change over time (e.g., no live website).
  score: 1
  reason: The environment setup is static and does not change over time.

II.7:
  check: Annotated ground truth is verified for correctness.
  score: 1
  reason: The data annotation process contains a verification step, as discussed in Section 3.4 of the paper.

II.8:
  check: Each task is verified to be solvable.
  score: 1
  reason: The data annotation process contains a verification step, as discussed in Section 3.4 of the paper.

II.9:
  check: Benchmark includes an Oracle solver that can automatically solve all tasks.
  score: 0
  reason: The benchmark does not include an Oracle solver that can automatically solve all tasks.

II.10:
  check: Implementation is free of vulnerabilities that could be exploited to pass evaluations without completing tasks.
  score: 1
  reason: No vulnerabilities are found in the implementation of the benchmark.

III.1:
  check: Is fully or at least partially open-sourced.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark is open-sourced and available on HuggingFace.

III.2:
  check: Offers an open-source evaluation harness for users.
  score: 0
  reason: The benchmark does not provide an open-source evaluation harness for users.

III.3:
  check: Includes measures to prevent data contamination, such as a private, held-out test set.
  score: 0
  reason: The benchmark does not contain measures to prevent data contamination.

III.4:
  check: Includes measures or plans to consistently update tasks over time to avoid overfitting.
  score: 0
  reason: The report does not discuss plans to consistently update tasks over time.

III.5:
  check: Clearly states the relationship between the agent capabilities it aims to evaluate and the constructs or outcomes it measures.
  score: 1
  reason: Such a relationship is clearly stated in Section 3 of the paper.

III.6:
  check: Clearly states the evaluation subjective of the benchmark (e.g., a model or an agent framework).
  score: 1
  reason: As discussed in Section 3 of the paper, the benchmark is designed to evaluate LLM models.

III.7:
  check: Describes steps taken to prevent, identify, and correct flaws.
  score: 1
  reason: Section 5 of the paper discusses the efforts, including comparing evaluation with or without human in the loop.

III.8:
  check: Includes qualitative discussions of the potential impact of unavoidable flaws.
  score: 1
  reason: Section 6 discusses the potential impact of unavoidable flaws, such as a wrong reasoning trace resulting in a correct answer.

III.9:
  check: Includes quantitative analysis to assess the impact of unavoidable flaws (e.g., noise of ground truth).
  score: 0
  reason: The report does not include quantitative analysis to assess the impact of unavoidable flaws.

III.10:
  check: Reports metrics about statistical significance, such as confidence intervals.
  score: 0
  reason: The report does not include any metrics about statistical significance.

III.11:
  check: Provides guidance on interpreting results with eval flaws.
  score: 0
  reason: The report does not provide any guidance on interpreting results with eval flaws.

III.12:
  check: Reports results of non-AI baselines (e.g., human experts).
  score: 1
  reason: Human performance is reported in Section 4 of the paper.

III.13:
  check: Reports results of trivial agents (e.g., one that does nothing).
  score: 1
  reason: The report includes results of search engine, which can be considered a trivial agent.
