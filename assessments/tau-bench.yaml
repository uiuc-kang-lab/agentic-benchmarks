O.a.1:
  check: Considers expressions semantically equivalent to ground truth.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark uses minimal expressions for substring matching, which is robust to variations in the input.

O.a.2:
  check: Handles redundant words used by agents.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark uses minimal expressions for substring matching, which is robust to redundant words in the input.

O.b.1:
  check: Handles negation modifiers used by agents.
  score: 0
  reason: The benchmark does not specify how negation modifiers are handled, which may lead to incorrect evaluations.

O.b.2:
  check: Is robust against systematically listing all possible answers.
  score: 0
  reason: The benchmark does not specify how it handles systematic listing of all possible answers, which may lead to incorrect evaluations.

O.b.3:
  check: Ground truth is sufficiently complex to prevent guessing.
  score: 0
  reason: A part of tasks has empty ground truth, which may lead to guessing.

O.g.1:
  check: Ground truth includes all states achievable after success.
  score: 1
  reason: The database after successful completion of a task is unique and includes all states.

O.g.2:
  check: Checks relevant and irrelevant states for the tasks.
  score: 1
  reason: The state of the database is the only environment state, and it is checked for both relevant and irrelevant parts.

O.g.3:
  check: Ground truth is complex to prevent trivial state modifications.
  score: 0
  reason: A part of tasks has empty ground truth, which may lead to trivial state modifications.

T.1:
  check: Versions of all tools (e.g., Python) are clearly specified.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark does not use external tools.

T.2:
  check: All required API tools are consistently accessible to agents during evaluation.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark does not use external APIs.

T.3:
  check: Evaluation process terminates or handles errors appropriately if an API becomes inaccessible.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark does not use external APIs.

T.4:
  check: Residual data or state are fully cleared between runs.
  score: 1
  reason: Residual data or state are fully cleared between runs by re-initializing the database.

T.5:
  check: Agent is completely isolated from any ground truth information.
  score: 1
  reason: Agents has no access to the file system.

T.6:
  check: Setup does not change over time (e.g., no live website).
  score: 1
  reason: The environment setup is static and does not change over time.

T.7:
  check: Annotated ground truth is verified for correctness.
  score: 1
  reason: As shown in Section 4 of the paper, the ground truth is manually verified.

T.8:
  check: Each task is verified to be solvable.
  score: 1
  reason: As shown in Section 4 of the paper, each task is verified to be solvable by the agent.

T.9:
  check: Benchmark includes an Oracle solver that can automatically solve all tasks.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark provides a reference task solution that can be used as an Oracle solver.

T.10:
  check: Implementation is free of vulnerabilities that could be exploited to pass evaluations without completing tasks.
  score: 1
  reason: No vulnerabilities are found in the implementation of the benchmark, and the evaluation process is secure.

R.1:
  check: Is fully or at least partially open-sourced.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark is open-sourced and available on GitHub.

R.2:
  check: Offers an open-source evaluation harness for users.
  score: 1
  reason: The benchmark provides an open-source evaluation harness for users.

R.3:
  check: Includes measures to prevent data contamination, such as a private, held-out test set.
  score: 0
  reason: The benchmark does not discuss measures to prevent data contamination.

R.4:
  check: Includes measures or plans to consistently update tasks over time to avoid overfitting.
  score: 0
  reason: The report does not discuss plans to consistently update tasks over time. 

R.5:
  check: Clearly states the relationship between the agent capabilities it aims to evaluate and the constructs or outcomes it measures.
  score: 1
  reason: Such a relationship is clearly stated in Section 3 of the paper.

R.6:
  check: Clearly states the evaluation subjective of the benchmark (e.g., a model or an agent framework).
  score: 1
  reason: As discussed in Section 5 of the paper, the benchmark is designed to evaluate both the model and the agent framework.

R.7:
  check: Describes steps taken to prevent, identify, and correct flaws.
  score: 1
  reason: Appendix A of the paper shows the efforts taken to detect annotation errors.

R.8:
  check: Includes qualitative discussions of the potential impact of unavoidable flaws.
  score: 1
  reason: Section 6 discusses the potential impact of unavoidable flaws, although these discussions are not sufficient.

R.9:
  check: Includes quantitative analysis to assess the impact of unavoidable flaws (e.g., noise of ground truth).
  score: 0
  reason: The report does not include quantitative analysis to assess the impact of unavoidable flaws.

R.10:
  check: Reports metrics about statistical significance, such as confidence intervals.
  score: 0
  reason: The report does not include any metrics about statistical significance.
